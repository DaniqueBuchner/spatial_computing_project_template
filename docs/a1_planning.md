#### Narratives
**Student**

*Week day*

“I am currently studying to get a master’s degree in philosophy. Due to the coronavirus, I have to do the majority of my study from home. I start my day by having breakfast with my roommates. Afterwards, I go to the coffee corner to get some coffee to fuel the day ahead. I always study in the library because I think it’s important to have a separation between work and recreation. I took lunch to the library since I can’t afford the time it takes to have lunch. After a long day of studying, I go past the shop before going home to get dinner. After having dinner at home, I go to the cafe to meet up with some friends living in the neighbourhood. I go back home around 10 o’clock and watch some Netflix in bed.”

*Weekend day*

“On Saturday mornings, my girlfriend and I always sleep in. We start our day by going to the shop together to get some breakfast. We eat our breakfast at home, and since we both enjoy working out, we decide to go to the gym. After our workout, we go back home to take a shower. The weather is very nice today, so we sit outside in the garden for a bit and get a drink at the cafe. After our drinks, we go to the arcade to play some games. We are both very competitive. We decided to have dinner at home today. After dinner, we stayed at home to clean up the house and chill.”

*Week day*

“In the morning we start our day with some breakfast from the shop. Each day 
we walk together to the shop at around 10 o’clock. My partner has a walker, so it’s nice that everything is close by and we can use the elevator. On our way back we stop by the community centre to talk to my neighbours. After breakfast, we often go to the park with some friends from the building. We walk to the coffee corner to get some drinks while we are sitting near the park. On our way back everyone goes to their house by using the community centre. In the afternoon we go to a town to have lunch. When we arrive at the building, we park our car and walk to our house. I will go to the library to read some books while my partner is catching up on some sleep. I go to the shop to get the ingredients for dinner and I visited a nice family who is staying in a starter house. We eat and then go to bed.”
