## Process

### Context analysis
Before diving in to the code and the notebooks, we did a little analysis of the location. In the map below, the position of our plot in the city of Rotterdam is shown. (Scale 1:10000)

In this next map, we zoom in a little more and highlight the already existing facilities surrounding our potential building. (Scale 1:1500)

### Design goals
We want to cerate a building that is designed for sustainability, in multiple ways. Our building should have the following characteristics:

+ Clear separation between private and public areas (Clustering)

+ Clear separation between private facilities and public facilities

+ Neighbourhood enrichment; mixed-use(rs), gathering of different types of people

+ Specific focus on the following sustainable topics:

    + socially; foster social interactions, but donâ€™t force people
    + energy efficient; energy generation instead of consumption
    + energy efficient; materials, waste, compact area of facades
    + methodology; modularity, circularity 
    + embedded technology; water storage, heat stress reduction, biodiversity
