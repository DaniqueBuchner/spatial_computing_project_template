## Process

### Context analysis
Before diving in to the code and the notebooks, we did a little analysis of the location. In the maps below, the position of our plot in the city of Rotterdam is shown. Furthermore, the facilities, infrastructure and nature surrounding our buidling are shown. Finally, a simplified solar path is presented to get a sense of what influence the sun has on the plot.

### Design goals
We want to cerate a building that is designed for sustainability, in multiple ways. Our building should have the following characteristics:

+ Clear separation between private and public areas (Clustering)

+ Clear separation between private facilities and public facilities

+ Neighbourhood enrichment; mixed-use(rs), gathering of different types of people

+ Specific focus on the following sustainable topics:

    + socially; foster social interactions, but donâ€™t force people
    + energy efficient; energy generation instead of consumption
    + energy efficient; materials, waste, compact area of facades
    + methodology; modularity, circularity 
    + embedded technology; water storage, heat stress reduction, biodiversity
