# About
#### Spatial Computing in Architectural Design 4.0

This site is part of the design project of the minor Spatial Computing in Architectural Design within the faculty of Architecture at the TU Delft. The courses that are linked to this minor are Computational Design Studio (BK7083) and Computational Simulations (BK7084). This particular project belongs to course BK7083.

### The team
This team contains of four students. We started this project with five students, but unfortunately Gerlinde Havelaar decided to stop with the minor. Below you can see the names of the students that represent this group and what good qualities they possess. Last you see the tutors that gave instructions and helped us with this project.

We have learned a lot during the minor. Especially in the beginning the learning curve was really steep. Sometimes we had the feeling that we would drown in the quantity of information. However, thanks to the collaboration within the group and the necessary guidance from the teachers we managed to gain control over the code and over our building. For us, the most important take away is the different way of thinking about architecture and how to make a building. This minor ensures that your own vision on how to design a building is questioned and by asking retoric questions about architecture and the way humankind is designing, the minor helps you thinking about what architecture and designing actually mean for yourself. This other way of thinking is really interesting and very valuable for our careers.  

 We want to thank our teachers for their support!
